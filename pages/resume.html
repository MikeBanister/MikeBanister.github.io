                    Managed existing relationships within a large portfolio of commercial loans worth over $700 million. Clients included national REITs, neighbourhood developers and multifamily investors.

                <li>
                    Continuously monitored active loan portfolio for material changes and declining key performance metrics. This allowed me to proactively identify and communicate potential risks to the client’s business.

                    Underwrote and funded CMHC backed multifamily loans for three Edmonton  apartment construction projects each worth more than $50 million. These loan facilities allowed for longer amortization periods and insulation against rising interest rates and were the decisive factor that enabled our borrowers to undertake the projects.

                <li>
                    Constructed a method for modeling the sensitivity of a Mortgage Investment Company’s residential loan portfolio. This model analyzed potential changes in home prices and interest rates which determined at what combination of factors ATB’s underlying loans could potentially be in default. My analysis allowed Senior Management and operational leadership to understand the risks of the loan portfolios.
